# The basics of Git

## Introduction

New first sentence from macbook pro. Git is a version control system. A NEW DIFFERENCE FROM IMAC. It`s design to be used in the development of big software systems (the Linux kernel, ca. 1500 distributed developers). We will only use a tiny bit of the system, i.e. the most basic functionality. ANOTHER DIFFERENCE FROM IMAC. Some more just to be able to commit.

THIS IS ALSO FROM THE IMAC. ENTERING SOME NEW STUFF HERE.


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
