# Introduction

Just a sentence to check that git works from my virtual PC.
I think it`s fixed now. 
Merge conflict opens in RStudio editor also on PC. 
This is added for the pull request.

## Density plot

```{r xdensity}
set.seed(5566)
x <- data.frame(
  x=rnorm(
    1000000, 
    mean = 3, 
    sd = 1
    )
  )
mean(x$x); sd(x$x)
ggplot(x, aes(x)) +
  geom_density()

rm(x)
```

## Points plot

We will be using the `cars` dataset. See `help(cars)` for details about the two variables.

```{r cars-summary}
summary(cars)
```

```{r cars-points-plot}
ggplot(cars, mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Spline

We might want to add a smooth. 
Some more small edits on kommentarer.

```{r cars-points-plot-smooth, message=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, mapping = aes(x = speed, y = dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
Will this line be merged without ptoblem.

### Linear model

We might also want a plain linear model.

```{r cars-points-plot-smooth-lm, message=FALSE}
ggplot(cars, 
       mapping = aes(
         x = speed, 
         y = dist)
       ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r summary-lm}
mod <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
summary(mod)
```

## Conclusions

We are now working in branch conclusions. The conclusion must be that git is a lot of fun, but can sometimes be a little bit challenging. Remember: Keep smiling ;-)
