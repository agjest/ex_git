# The basics of Git

## Introduction

Ny f√∏rste setning fra imac. Git is a version control system. It`s design to be used in the development of big software systems (the Linux kernel, ca. 1500 distributed developers). We will only use a tiny bit of the system, i.e. the most basic functionality. Some more just to be able to commit.


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
